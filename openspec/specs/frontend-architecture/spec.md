# frontend-architecture Specification

## Purpose

Define dashboard surface contracts so settings, account management, and operational views stay coherent across the SPA.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Settings page
The Settings page SHALL include sections for: routing settings (sticky threads, reset priority, prompt-cache affinity TTL), password management (setup/change/remove), TOTP management (setup/disable), API key auth toggle, API key management (table, create, edit, delete, regenerate), and sticky-session administration.

#### Scenario: Save prompt-cache affinity TTL
- **WHEN** a user updates the prompt-cache affinity TTL from the routing settings section
- **THEN** the app calls `PUT /api/settings` with the updated TTL and reflects the saved value

#### Scenario: View sticky-session mappings
- **WHEN** a user opens the sticky-session section on the Settings page
- **THEN** the app fetches sticky-session entries and displays each mapping's kind, account, timestamps, and stale/expiry state

#### Scenario: Purge stale prompt-cache mappings
- **WHEN** a user requests a stale purge from the sticky-session section
- **THEN** the app calls the sticky-session purge API and refreshes the list afterward

### Requirement: Accounts page

The Accounts page SHALL display a two-column layout: left panel with searchable account list, import button, and add account button; right panel with selected account details including usage, token info, and actions (pause/resume/delete/re-authenticate). The browser OAuth stage SHALL show an authorization URL with a copy action that remains functional in secure and non-secure contexts.

The Accounts page SHALL keep the add account button outside the scrollable account list so it remains reachable without scrolling through existing accounts.

The Accounts page SHALL keep long account lists in a bounded internal scroll region on desktop so account rows do not push the page layout past the selected-account detail panel.

The Accounts page SHALL also allow exporting a selected account as an OpenCode-compatible `auth.json` payload with explicit raw-token warnings.

#### Scenario: Account selection

- **WHEN** a user clicks an account in the list
- **THEN** the right panel shows the selected account's details

#### Scenario: Account import

- **WHEN** a user clicks the import button and uploads an auth.json file
- **THEN** the app calls `POST /api/accounts/import` and refreshes the account list on success

#### Scenario: OAuth add account

- **WHEN** a user clicks the add account button
- **THEN** an OAuth dialog opens with browser and device code flow options

#### Scenario: Add account remains outside account list scrolling

- **WHEN** the Accounts page renders the account list controls
- **THEN** the add account button is not a child of the scrollable account list
- **AND** the button remains available without scrolling through existing accounts

#### Scenario: Long account list scrolls inside the left panel

- **WHEN** the Accounts page renders more account rows than fit in the visible left panel
- **THEN** the account rows scroll inside the account list region
- **AND** the add account action remains visible outside that scroll region

#### Scenario: OAuth browser authorization URL copy fallback

- **WHEN** a user clicks Copy for the browser authorization URL inside the OAuth dialog
- **THEN** the copy operation succeeds using secure Clipboard API when available
- **AND** falls back to dialog-scoped `execCommand("copy")` when secure Clipboard API is unavailable or blocked

#### Scenario: OAuth browser authorization URL copy failure feedback

- **WHEN** both clipboard copy paths fail for the browser authorization URL inside the OAuth dialog
- **THEN** the dialog surfaces a visible copy failure message

#### Scenario: Device OAuth start begins polling

- **WHEN** the app starts Device Code OAuth with `POST /api/oauth/start`
- **AND** the response includes a `deviceAuthId` and `userCode`
- **THEN** the backend starts polling for the device token without requiring a separate `/api/oauth/complete` call
- **AND** a later `/api/oauth/complete` call remains safe and does not start a duplicate polling task

#### Scenario: Account actions

- **WHEN** a user clicks pause/resume/delete on an account
- **THEN** the corresponding API is called and the account list is refreshed

#### Scenario: Concurrent browser OAuth sessions stay isolated

- **WHEN** two browser PKCE OAuth sessions are started concurrently from separate dashboard tabs or operators
- **AND** each session later submits its own callback URL
- **THEN** each callback is matched against the flow that minted its `state` token
- **AND** one flow does not invalidate or overwrite the other flow's callback state

#### Scenario: Browser OAuth link refresh

- **WHEN** a user is on the browser PKCE step of the OAuth dialog
- **AND** the current authorization URL has already been used or needs to be replaced
- **THEN** the dialog offers a refresh action that starts the browser OAuth flow again without leaving the dialog
- **AND** the dialog updates to the newly generated authorization URL

#### Scenario: Export selected account from dashboard

- **WHEN** a user clicks the OpenCode export action for a selected account
- **THEN** the dashboard requests a per-account export from the backend
- **AND** shows copy/download controls for the official OpenCode `auth.json` payload
- **AND** warns that the payload contains raw account tokens

#### Scenario: OAuth reauth refreshes the existing ChatGPT identity row

- **GIVEN** a local account row already has a non-empty upstream `chatgpt_account_id`
- **AND** the account is re-authenticated through the dashboard OAuth flow
- **WHEN** the new OAuth token payload carries the same upstream `chatgpt_account_id`
- **THEN** the service updates the existing local row instead of creating a duplicate account row
- **AND** the refreshed row is active and carries the latest OAuth tokens and account metadata

#### Scenario: Concurrent OAuth reauth completions do not create duplicate rows

- **GIVEN** two OAuth reauth completions for the same upstream `chatgpt_account_id` finish concurrently
- **WHEN** both completions persist their token payloads
- **THEN** exactly one local account row exists for that upstream identity

### Requirement: Request logs display account plan tier
When a request log entry is associated with an account, the dashboard request-log API response MUST expose the persisted request-log `planType` snapshot, and the recent-requests table MUST render the plan tier in a visible request-log column or badge.

#### Scenario: Request log entry keeps its original plan type snapshot
- **WHEN** a request log entry is written while the associated account's `plan_type` is `free`
- **AND** the account later changes to `team`
- **THEN** the `GET /api/request-logs` response still includes `planType: "free"` for that row
- **AND** the dashboard recent-requests table renders the original `free` plan tier visibly for that row

#### Scenario: Legacy request log entry without account still renders
- **WHEN** a request log entry has no related account
- **THEN** the `GET /api/request-logs` response includes `planType: null` or omits it
- **AND** the dashboard recent-requests table still renders the row without failing

### Requirement: Request logs distinguish actual and requested service tiers
When a request log entry includes service-tier data, the dashboard request-log API response MUST expose the billable tier, requested tier, and actual tier separately. The recent-requests UI MUST display the actual tier when available and MUST show the requested tier when it differs from the visible actual tier.

#### Scenario: Dashboard shows upstream-selected tier and requested tier
- **WHEN** a request log entry is recorded with `requested_service_tier: "priority"`, `actual_service_tier: "default"`, and billable `service_tier: "default"`
- **THEN** the `GET /api/request-logs` response includes `requestedServiceTier: "priority"`, `actualServiceTier: "default"`, and `serviceTier: "default"`
- **AND** the dashboard renders the model label with `default`
- **AND** the dashboard also shows that the request asked for `priority`

### Requirement: Accounts list surfaces quota reset timing
The Accounts page account list SHALL render a compact 5h quota row and a weekly quota row for accounts that have both quota windows, and SHALL include the time remaining until reset for each rendered row when a reset timestamp is available. Weekly-only accounts SHALL omit the 5h row.

#### Scenario: Regular account shows both quota rows
- **WHEN** the account list renders an account with both primary and weekly quota windows
- **THEN** the list item shows both 5h and weekly quota rows
- **AND** each rendered row shows its reset countdown

#### Scenario: Weekly-only account omits the 5h row
- **WHEN** the account list renders an account whose primary window is absent
- **THEN** the list item does not render a 5h quota row
- **AND** the weekly quota row still renders

### Requirement: Accounts list respects compact row appearance preference
The Accounts page account list SHALL honor a locally stored appearance preference that selects which compact quota rows are shown: 5h, weekly, or both. The default preference SHALL be Both. When the selected row is unavailable for a given account, the list MAY fall back to the available row so the account still shows quota information.

#### Scenario: Default preference shows both rows
- **WHEN** the appearance preference is unset
- **THEN** the account list shows both 5h and weekly rows for accounts that have both quota windows

#### Scenario: 5h preference shows only the 5h row
- **WHEN** the appearance preference is set to 5H
- **THEN** the account list shows the 5h row and hides the weekly row for accounts that have both quota windows

#### Scenario: Weekly preference shows only the weekly row
- **WHEN** the appearance preference is set to W
- **THEN** the account list shows the weekly row and hides the 5h row for accounts that have both quota windows

### Requirement: Accounts list orders by next reset
The Accounts page account list SHALL order accounts by the earliest upcoming quota reset timestamp among the rendered quota windows. Accounts without any reset timestamp SHALL sort after accounts with a reset timestamp. When reset timestamps are equal or unavailable, the list MAY fall back to a stable text-based order.

#### Scenario: Earlier reset sorts first
- **WHEN** two accounts are shown in the account list and one account has an earlier quota reset time than the other
- **THEN** the earlier-reset account appears before the later-reset account

### Requirement: Dashboard request-log filtering supports API keys

The dashboard request logs view SHALL allow operators to filter rows by one or more API keys using stable API key identifiers while presenting human-readable API key labels in the UI.

#### Scenario: Apply API key request-log filter

- **WHEN** a user selects one or more API keys in the request logs filters
- **THEN** the request logs query refetches from `GET /api/request-logs` with repeated `apiKeyId` parameters
- **AND** the dashboard overview is NOT refetched

#### Scenario: Request-log API key options remain expandable

- **WHEN** a user has already selected one API key in the request logs filters
- **THEN** the API key filter options continue to show other matching API keys instead of collapsing to only the selected key
- **AND** the user can add another API key without clearing the existing selection first

### Requirement: Dashboard weekly credits pace

The dashboard SHALL show weekly quota pace when account weekly capacity credits, remaining credits, reset time, and window length are available. The pace calculation MUST use credit totals rather than averaging per-account percentages, because weekly ChatGPT quota credits are not the same unit as raw request tokens. The dashboard MUST prefer the backend-provided `weeklyCreditPace` object from `GET /api/dashboard/overview` when present, and MAY fall back to a local calculation only for older responses that do not include that field. The backend schedule MUST support operator-configured weekly pace working days, defaulting to all days, and MUST exclude non-working days from scheduled-by-now and pace-gap math when a restricted schedule is configured.

#### Scenario: Weekly credits pace uses account reset deadlines

- **WHEN** multiple accounts have weekly quota data with different `resetAtSecondary` values
- **THEN** the system computes each account's expected remaining weekly credits from that account's own reset time and window length before summing totals

#### Scenario: Weekly credits pace excludes inactive or stale usage rows

- **WHEN** an account is not active or its latest weekly usage sample is older than the freshness window derived from the usage refresh interval
- **THEN** the account is not included in weekly pace totals or forecasts
- **AND** the response reports the excluded stale account count separately from the included account count

#### Scenario: Current schedule gap is separate from forecast shortfall

- **WHEN** actual remaining weekly credits are lower than scheduled remaining weekly credits
- **THEN** the response reports `scheduleGapCredits` for the current deficit against the linear schedule
- **AND** the response reports `projectedShortfallCredits` only for a future shortfall forecast based on recent burn
- **AND** the dashboard labels the two concepts separately

#### Scenario: Forecast burn uses recent weekly usage slope

- **WHEN** an account has high cumulative weekly usage from earlier in the window but no recent increase in weekly used percent
- **THEN** the projected shortfall forecast is based on the recent slope and does not assume the earlier full-window average continues

#### Scenario: Near-reset depletion is not a false alarm

- **WHEN** an account has consumed 99% of its weekly quota and 99% of its weekly window has elapsed
- **THEN** the weekly pace treats that account as on pace rather than over plan

#### Scenario: Missing weekly credit data is omitted

- **WHEN** an account is missing weekly capacity credits, remaining credits, reset time, or window length
- **THEN** that account is omitted from weekly pace calculation

#### Scenario: No valid weekly credit data hides pace

- **WHEN** no account has complete, active, fresh weekly credits pace data
- **THEN** the dashboard does not render a fake weekly pace value

#### Scenario: Default working days preserve linear weekly pace

- **WHEN** weekly pace working days are unset or configured to all seven days
- **THEN** the scheduled remaining credits and scheduled burn rate match the existing linear weekly-window schedule

#### Scenario: Configured working days exclude non-working schedule time

- **WHEN** weekly pace working days are configured to Monday through Friday
- **AND** the current time is inside a Saturday or Sunday portion of the weekly window
- **THEN** scheduled-by-now does not advance during that non-working day
- **AND** `scheduleGapCredits` compares actual remaining credits against the configured working-day schedule

### Requirement: Account weekly trend planned line

The account detail usage trend SHALL include an ideal weekly remaining line when weekly reset timing is available, so operators can compare actual weekly remaining credits against the linear schedule between weekly resets.

#### Scenario: Weekly trend shows planned depletion between resets

- **WHEN** account trend buckets include weekly reset time and window length
- **THEN** the account 7-day trend includes a dashed weekly plan line computed from each bucket's reset deadline and window length

#### Scenario: Weekly trend plan restarts after reset

- **WHEN** weekly trend buckets cross into a new reset window with a new reset deadline
- **THEN** the planned line jumps back toward full remaining capacity for the new weekly window instead of continuing one global diagonal

### Requirement: Dashboard request-log list excludes deleted-account rows

When an account is deleted, request-log rows that were soft-deleted as part of that account removal MUST NOT appear in the dashboard request-log list or request-log filter-option facets.

#### Scenario: Deleted account log hidden from recent request rows

- **GIVEN** a request log row was previously associated with an account
- **AND** deleting that account soft-deleted the row
- **WHEN** a user loads `GET /api/request-logs`
- **THEN** the soft-deleted row is not included in the `requests` payload

#### Scenario: Deleted account log hidden from request-log facets

- **GIVEN** a request log row was previously associated with an account
- **AND** deleting that account soft-deleted the row
- **WHEN** a user loads `GET /api/request-logs/options`
- **THEN** the soft-deleted row does not contribute account, model, API-key, or status facet options

### Requirement: Dashboard overview metrics keep soft-deleted request logs

Dashboard overview request metrics and trends MUST continue to aggregate soft-deleted request-log rows so account deletion does not rewrite historical request activity.

#### Scenario: Deleted account log still counted in overview metrics

- **GIVEN** an account has request-log activity within the active overview timeframe
- **AND** the account is deleted afterward
- **WHEN** a user loads `GET /api/dashboard/overview`
- **THEN** request-derived metrics and trends still include that historical request-log activity

### Requirement: Dashboard settings page exposes password session lifetime

The SPA settings page SHALL expose a dashboard password session lifetime control for operators when password management is enabled. The control SHALL display the current configured lifetime, validate an operator-supplied value against the backend minimum, and save the new lifetime through the existing settings API. When the configured lifetime exceeds 30 days, the SPA SHALL show a warning that the longer lifetime increases the impact of a leaked browser profile or stolen cookie.

#### Scenario: Admin updates dashboard password session lifetime

- **WHEN** an admin opens the Settings page and changes the dashboard session lifetime value
- **THEN** the SPA submits the updated lifetime through `/api/settings`
- **AND** the saved settings response reflects the new lifetime value

#### Scenario: Admin chooses a long dashboard session lifetime

- **WHEN** an admin enters a dashboard session lifetime greater than 30 days
- **THEN** the Settings page shows a warning explaining that the longer lifetime increases the impact of a leaked browser profile or stolen cookie
- **AND** the admin can still save the configured lifetime

### Requirement: Account summary duplicate email indicator

The dashboard accounts API SHALL expose an `isEmailDuplicate` boolean on each
`AccountSummary` returned by `GET /api/accounts`. The field MUST be `true` when
another account row in the same response has the same real email address and
the same ChatGPT account identity, and MUST be `false` for unique real
email/identity pairs. Missing, blank, and legacy placeholder emails equal to
`DEFAULT_EMAIL` (`unknown@example.com`) MUST be excluded from duplicate
detection and MUST NOT be flagged as duplicates. Rows that share an email but
belong to different ChatGPT account identities MUST NOT be flagged as
duplicates.

#### Scenario: Duplicate real email and identity pairs are flagged

- **WHEN** `GET /api/accounts` returns two or more account rows with the same real non-placeholder email and the same ChatGPT account identity
- **THEN** every row in that email and identity group includes `isEmailDuplicate: true`

#### Scenario: Same email across identities is not flagged

- **WHEN** `GET /api/accounts` returns account rows with the same real non-placeholder email but different ChatGPT account identities
- **THEN** those rows include `isEmailDuplicate: false`

#### Scenario: Placeholder emails are ignored

- **WHEN** `GET /api/accounts` returns two or more account rows whose email is `unknown@example.com`
- **THEN** those rows include `isEmailDuplicate: false`

#### Scenario: Unique emails are not flagged

- **WHEN** `GET /api/accounts` returns an account row with an email that appears only once in the response
- **THEN** that row includes `isEmailDuplicate: false`

### Requirement: Dashboard projections load after the primary dashboard data

The dashboard SPA SHALL render primary dashboard content from `GET /api/dashboard/overview`
and recent request-log data without waiting for depletion or weekly-credit projection
calculations. Projection-only data, including safe-line depletion markers and weekly-credit
pace, SHALL be available from `GET /api/dashboard/projections` and fetched after overview
data is available.

#### Scenario: Main dashboard renders before projections finish

- **GIVEN** an authenticated operator opens the dashboard
- **WHEN** `GET /api/dashboard/overview` and request-log calls complete before `GET /api/dashboard/projections`
- **THEN** the dashboard renders the primary cards, usage donuts, account list, and request-log surface
- **AND** projection-only safe-line and weekly-credit fields may populate later when the projections response arrives

#### Scenario: Projection endpoint exposes heavy dashboard calculations

- **WHEN** the dashboard client requests `GET /api/dashboard/projections`
- **THEN** the response includes depletion safe-line data and weekly-credit pace data when those calculations are available
- **AND** the overview endpoint does not need to compute those fields for initial page render

### Requirement: Dashboard usage donuts present credits as stacked remaining and capacity

The dashboard's primary and secondary usage donuts MUST present remaining credits and capacity as two stacked values separated by a horizontal divider: the remaining count above (bold, `data-testid="donut-center-remaining"`) and the capacity count below (muted, `data-testid="donut-center-capacity"`). Both values MUST use locale-aware thousands separators (e.g. `7,331` and `7,560`). Compact-format abbreviation (e.g. `7.33k`) MUST NOT be used in the donut center for these panels.

The primary donut title MUST read `5-Hour Credits`. The secondary donut title MUST read `Weekly Credits`.

#### Scenario: Dashboard donut shows stacked remaining and capacity

- **WHEN** the dashboard renders a usage donut with `remaining=7331` and `total=7560`
- **THEN** the donut title reads `5-Hour Credits` or `Weekly Credits`
- **AND** the center renders `7,331` in the remaining element and `7,560` in the capacity element
- **AND** a divider separates the two values

### Requirement: API sidebar shows pooled credit bars

The APIs page left sidebar SHALL render pooled credit bars on each API key list item. Each bar SHALL display a label, percentage, and colored progress bar using the same `MiniQuotaBar` component as the Accounts sidebar.

Labels SHALL be "Pooled 5h" for the primary window and "Pooled Weekly" for the secondary window. No reset countdown text SHALL be shown.

When `pooledCapacityCreditsPrimary > 0` and `pooledRemainingPercentPrimary` is not null, the "Pooled 5h" bar SHALL be visible. Otherwise it SHALL be hidden. The "Pooled Weekly" bar SHALL be visible when `pooledRemainingPercentSecondary` is not null.

When both bars are visible, they SHALL be laid out in a 2-column grid. When only one bar is visible, it SHALL use a 1-column layout.

When API key limit rules exist, the sidebar SHALL also render the legacy limit progress bar below the pooled bars with an "API Limit" label and percentage value so it remains clearly distinct from the pooled-account bars.

#### Scenario: Both pooled bars visible

- **WHEN** an API key has both primary and secondary pooled credit data
- **THEN** the sidebar item shows "Pooled 5h" and "Pooled Weekly" bars in a 2-column grid

#### Scenario: Primary bar hidden for free-tier accounts

- **WHEN** an API key's pooled primary capacity is 0
- **THEN** only the "Pooled Weekly" bar is shown in a 1-column layout

#### Scenario: No credit data hides bars

- **WHEN** an API key has no pooled credit data
- **THEN** no credit bars are rendered on that list item

#### Scenario: API limit bar is labeled distinctly

- **WHEN** an API key has configured limit rules
- **THEN** the sidebar renders the legacy limit bar with an "API Limit" label below the pooled bars

### Requirement: Footer version update indicator

The dashboard footer SHALL show the running application version and SHALL display a compact update-available icon next to that version only when the runtime version API confirms a newer stable GitHub release exists.

#### Scenario: Newer release is available

- **WHEN** `GET /api/runtime/version` returns `updateAvailable: true` with a `latestVersion`
- **THEN** the footer renders an accessible update icon beside the current version
- **AND** the icon links to `https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/releases/latest`
- **AND** the icon title or accessible label includes the latest version

#### Scenario: Version lookup is unavailable

- **WHEN** `GET /api/runtime/version` fails or returns no newer version
- **THEN** the footer continues showing the current version without an update indicator

### Requirement: Delete account with history purge

The account delete confirmation dialog SHALL include a checkbox labeled "Delete all history for this account". When checked and the delete action is confirmed, all associated data (request_logs, usage_history, sticky_sessions) SHALL be hard-deleted from the database instead of soft-deleted. When unchecked, the existing soft-delete behavior SHALL apply.

#### Scenario: Delete with history checkbox checked

- **WHEN** an operator opens the delete confirmation dialog for an account and checks "Delete all history for this account"
- **AND** clicks the confirm/Delete button
- **THEN** the `DELETE /api/accounts/{account_id}` request includes `?delete_history=true`
- **AND** all `request_logs` rows for the account are hard-deleted from the database
- **AND** `usage_history` rows for the account are hard-deleted (existing behavior)
- **AND** the account itself is deleted
- **AND** the UI shows a success toast and refreshes the account list

#### Scenario: Delete with history checkbox unchecked

- **WHEN** an operator opens the delete confirmation dialog and does NOT check "Delete all history for this account"
- **AND** clicks the confirm/Delete button
- **THEN** the `DELETE /api/accounts/{account_id}` request omits the `delete_history` parameter
- **AND** `request_logs` rows are soft-deleted (account_id=NULL, deleted_at set)
- **AND** all other behavior is identical to current account deletion

#### Scenario: Cancel the delete dialog

- **WHEN** an operator opens the delete confirmation dialog
- **AND** clicks the Cancel button
- **THEN** the dialog closes and no API request is made
- **AND** the account remains in the list unchanged

### Requirement: Dashboard limit warm-up controls

The dashboard SHALL expose global limit warm-up controls in Settings and per-account opt-in/status in account views. The global default SHALL be disabled.

#### Scenario: Configure warm-up behavior
- **WHEN** an operator opens Settings
- **THEN** the dashboard shows controls for enabling limit warm-up, selecting primary/secondary/both windows, setting the warm-up model, setting the prompt, and setting the cooldown

#### Scenario: Validate warm-up settings before save
- **WHEN** an operator edits warm-up model, prompt, or cooldown fields
- **THEN** the dashboard enforces the same non-empty, max-length, and integer cooldown bounds as the backend API before enabling save

#### Scenario: Show per-account opt-in and last attempt
- **WHEN** account summaries include limit warm-up status
- **THEN** the dashboard shows whether warm-up is enabled for that account
- **AND** it shows the latest attempt window, status, model, and completion/attempt time when available

#### Scenario: Warm-up controls are accessible by name
- **WHEN** an operator navigates the dashboard with assistive technology
- **THEN** global and per-account warm-up toggles expose descriptive accessible names that identify the setting and account context

### Requirement: Account alias contract

The dashboard accounts API SHALL expose an operator-controlled, human-readable `alias` on every account summary, and SHALL provide an endpoint that lets an authenticated dashboard session set or clear that alias. The alias MUST be persisted on the `Account` record and MUST be reflected in `AccountSummary.alias`. When a non-empty alias is set, the same `AccountSummary.display_name` field MUST resolve to the alias so consumers that already render `display_name` see the operator's chosen label without further changes. When the alias is null or cleared, `display_name` MUST fall back to the account's email so existing UI continues to identify the account.

#### Scenario: Listing surfaces the alias when set

- **WHEN** the dashboard requests `GET /api/accounts` and at least one account has a stored alias
- **THEN** that account's summary includes `alias` with the stored value
- **AND** its `display_name` equals the alias

#### Scenario: Listing falls back to email when alias is null

- **WHEN** the dashboard requests `GET /api/accounts` and an account has no stored alias
- **THEN** that account's summary includes `alias: null`
- **AND** its `display_name` equals the account's email

#### Scenario: Setting an alias persists and trims whitespace

- **WHEN** an authenticated dashboard session calls `PUT /api/accounts/{account_id}/alias` with `{"alias": "  Personal Plus  "}`
- **THEN** the response is 200 with `{"account_id": "...", "alias": "Personal Plus"}`
- **AND** subsequent `GET /api/accounts` reflects the trimmed value on both `alias` and `display_name`

#### Scenario: Empty or whitespace-only alias clears the value

- **WHEN** an authenticated dashboard session calls `PUT /api/accounts/{account_id}/alias` with `{"alias": ""}` or `{"alias": "   "}`
- **THEN** the response is 200 with `{"alias": null}`
- **AND** subsequent `GET /api/accounts` shows `alias: null` and `display_name` reverting to the account's email

#### Scenario: Setting alias on an unknown account returns 404

- **WHEN** `PUT /api/accounts/{account_id}/alias` is called with an `account_id` that does not exist
- **THEN** the response is 404 with error code `account_not_found`

#### Scenario: Dashboard UI edits and searches aliases

- **WHEN** an operator opens the dashboard accounts page and selects an account
- **THEN** the account detail panel provides an `Account alias` control that can save a non-empty alias through `PUT /api/accounts/{account_id}/alias`
- **AND** clearing the control stores `alias: null` and restores the email fallback
- **AND** account search matches the stored alias or alias-backed display name so operators can filter duplicate-email accounts by their chosen label

### Requirement: APIs tab shows a 7-day account-cost donut for selected API keys

When the selected API key's 7-day usage payload contains one or more `accountCosts[]` items, the APIs tab detail panel SHALL render the account-cost donut section and usage-trend section inside a single shared card. On large screens, the split layout SHALL use a 25:75 width ratio with the donut on the left, the trend on the right, and a vertical separator between them.

The donut section SHALL include a title and subtitle, SHALL show the 7-day total cost in the donut center, SHALL not render a separate `Total $...` summary in the section header, and SHALL render the legend below the donut.

#### Scenario: Donut renders inside the shared usage card
- **WHEN** a selected API key has 7-day account-cost data and trend data
- **THEN** the detail panel renders the account-cost donut section to the left of the trend section inside one shared card
- **AND** the large-screen layout uses a 25:75 split with a vertical separator between the sections

#### Scenario: Donut is omitted when no account-cost buckets exist
- **WHEN** the selected API key's `usage-7d.accountCosts[]` array is empty
- **THEN** the APIs tab does not render the account-cost donut card

### Requirement: APIs tab account-cost donut uses existing account labels and privacy rules

The donut legend SHALL use the account label derived from the existing payload fields: `Deleted Account` for `isDeleted: true`, otherwise the account `email` when present, otherwise `Unknown Account`. Non-deleted account labels MUST respect the hide-account-info privacy setting used elsewhere in the dashboard.

The legend SHALL show each visible bucket's 7-day cost, SHALL coordinate hover highlighting with the matching pie slice, and SHALL use the same vertically scrollable five-row viewport pattern as the dashboard donuts when more rows exist than fit without scrolling.

#### Scenario: Deleted account label is explicit
- **WHEN** an `accountCosts[]` item has `isDeleted: true`
- **THEN** the legend label is `Deleted Account`

#### Scenario: Privacy hiding applies to non-deleted account labels
- **WHEN** the hide-account-info setting is enabled
- **AND** a visible donut legend row represents a non-deleted account label
- **THEN** the label text is privacy-blurred

#### Scenario: Legend scroll viewport matches dashboard donuts
- **WHEN** more than five account-cost buckets are present
- **THEN** the donut legend keeps all rows available
- **AND** the visible legend viewport shows five rows before scrolling

### Requirement: APIs tab account-cost donut follows the dashboard donut visual system

The account-cost donut SHALL use the same sizing, palette generation, reduced-motion behavior, hover-linked legend highlighting, and gray consumed/deleted color treatment as the dashboard donut visual system.

#### Scenario: Deleted-account slice uses the consumed gray color
- **WHEN** the donut renders a deleted-account bucket
- **THEN** that bucket uses the same gray color family used by the dashboard donut's consumed or used segment

### Requirement: APIs tab usage trend control layout is compact in the split view

The APIs tab usage trend card SHALL keep its heading and subtitle, SHALL align the accumulated toggle and Tokens/Cost legend to the right side of the heading block on larger screens, and SHALL reduce the chart right margin to fit the split layout.

#### Scenario: Usage trend controls align with the heading row
- **WHEN** the usage trend card renders
- **THEN** the Tokens/Cost legend appears to the right of the heading block on larger screens
- **AND** the accumulated toggle remains in the same right-side controls group

#### Scenario: Usage trend uses compact right margin
- **WHEN** the usage trend chart renders in the split APIs-tab layout
- **THEN** the chart right margin is reduced from the previous wider layout to a compact right margin

### Requirement: Dashboard account summaries sorted by primary capacity

The dashboard overview API MUST return account summaries sorted by `capacity_credits_primary` in descending order so the highest-capacity accounts appear first. Accounts with no primary capacity MUST sort after accounts that have one.

#### Scenario: Accounts ordered by primary capacity

- **WHEN** the dashboard overview response includes multiple accounts with different `capacity_credits_primary` values
- **THEN** accounts are ordered from highest to lowest primary capacity

#### Scenario: Accounts without primary capacity sort last

- **WHEN** an account has `capacity_credits_primary` of `null` or `0`
- **THEN** that account appears after accounts with a positive primary capacity

### Requirement: Account card row height is 11.5rem

The dashboard account card viewport MUST use 11.5rem per visible row.

- **WHEN** a successful request log row has no persisted `output_tokens` and does have `reasoning_tokens`
- **THEN** `GET /api/request-logs` uses the reasoning-token value for `outputTokens`

#### Scenario: Request log response preserves shape for legacy partial data
- **WHEN** a successful request log row is missing one or more persisted token or cost segments
- **THEN** `GET /api/request-logs` still includes `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, and `costBreakdown`
- **AND** any unavailable top-level token field is returned as `null`
- **AND** `costBreakdown` includes `inputUsd`, `cachedInputUsd`, `outputUsd`, and `totalUsd`
- **AND** any unavailable `costBreakdown` field is returned as `null`
- **AND** clients can render only the available token and cost segments without treating the row as invalid

### Requirement: Request detail dialog renders successful cost breakdowns
The dashboard request-log `View Details` dialog MUST render a `Cost` section under `Archive` for successful request rows and MUST hide the section for non-success rows.

- **AND** each displayed segment includes its token count and matching currency value
- **AND** token counts use the same compact formatting as the request-log tokens column
- **AND** currency values are rounded to two decimals

#### Scenario: Missing cost segments are omitted without breaking the dialog

### Requirement: Reports page exposes visible filter controls

The `/reports` page SHALL expose visible filter controls for `7d`, `30d`, and `90d` quick presets, start date, end date, account, and model. When an authenticated operator clicks one of the quick presets, the page SHALL visibly highlight that preset. When the operator manually edits the start date or end date afterward, the page SHALL clear the quick-preset highlight until another quick preset is clicked. The start and end date inputs SHALL disallow selecting dates later than the browser's current local calendar date.

#### Scenario: Reports page shows report filter controls

#### Scenario: Quick preset highlight clears after manual date edits

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator clicks a quick preset on `/reports`
- **AND** then manually edits the start date or end date
- **THEN** the page clears the quick-preset highlight
- **AND** the page keeps the edited date range values

#### Scenario: Report date inputs disallow future dates

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator opens `/reports`
- **THEN** the start date and end date inputs prevent selecting a date later than the browser's current local calendar date

### Requirement: Reports page preserves reports query parameter names

Requests from `/reports` to `GET /api/reports` SHALL use the query parameter names `startDate`, `endDate`, `accountId`, and `model`.

#### Scenario: Reports page uses preserved reports query parameter names

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator opens `/reports` or changes a report filter
- **THEN** the request uses `startDate`, `endDate`, `accountId`, and `model` as the query parameter names

### Requirement: Reports chart tooltip uses recharts TooltipContentProps

The reports `ChartTooltip` component SHALL type its props as `Partial<TooltipContentProps>` from recharts so that context-injected properties (`payload`, `active`, `label`, `coordinate`) are optional at the JSX call site while remaining correctly typed inside the component body.

#### Scenario: ChartTooltip renders without context props at the JSX call site

- **WHEN** a reports chart passes `<ChartTooltip names={...} formatValue={...} />` via the recharts `<Tooltip content={...}>` prop
- **THEN** TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors about missing `payload`, `active`, `label`, or `coordinate`
- **AND** recharts injects those properties at runtime before calling the component

### Requirement: Request detail identifies cache-write usage and cost

The dashboard request-log contract MUST accept nullable cache-write token counts and cache-write dollar cost. Recent-request detail SHALL show cache writes as a category separate from ordinary input and cache reads when the value is present and positive.

#### Scenario: Request contains cache writes

- **WHEN** a historical request-log row has a null cache-write token count
- **THEN** the request detail remains valid
- **AND** it does not render a misleading cache-write segment

#### Scenario: Cache-write detail exists without cache-read detail

- **WHEN** a request log contains positive cache-write usage but omits the cache-read counter
- **THEN** the cost breakdown still identifies ordinary input and cache-write cost separately
- **AND** the cache-read cost remains zero rather than suppressing the cache-write category

### Requirement: Reasoning controls expose model-supported max and ultra levels

Dashboard model data MUST expose supported and default reasoning efforts. API-key create/edit controls MUST offer `max` and `ultra` when supported and MUST validate those values through the shared frontend schema.

#### Scenario: Operator selects an extended GPT-5.6 effort

- **WHEN** the operator configures an API key in the create or edit dialog
- **THEN** the advertised effort appears as a selectable option
- **AND** the submitted schema retains that exact configured value

### Requirement: Reports SHALL bucket retained history by the requested timezone

The Reports endpoint SHALL assign both live request rows and retained request aggregates to the same requested local-calendar-day boundaries. UTC storage dates MUST NOT change the displayed local date or cause a report request to fail.

#### Scenario: Retained request crosses UTC and local dates

- **GIVEN** a retained request aggregate whose UTC date is earlier than its date in the requested timezone
- **WHEN** the operator loads Reports for that local date
- **THEN** the aggregate SHALL appear under the requested local date
- **AND** the Reports endpoint SHALL return successfully

### Requirement: Accounts page unified export action

The Accounts page SHALL render a single "Export" button in the account actions area. Clicking the export button SHALL open a modal dialog titled "Auth Export" with a format mode selector ("codex" / "opencode"). The page SHALL use a single API call to `POST /api/accounts/{id}/export/auth` before opening the modal, and SHALL pass the full response to the modal for display. No auto-download SHALL occur without user interaction in the modal.

#### Scenario: Single export button replaces dual buttons

- **WHEN** a user views the account actions for a selected account
- **THEN** exactly one "Export" button is visible
- **AND** no separate "Export OpenCode auth" button is present

#### Scenario: Export opens modal after API success

- **AND** on success the "Auth Export" modal opens with the response data
- **AND** no file is downloaded until the user clicks Download in the modal

#### Scenario: Export error shows toast

- **WHEN** the `POST /api/accounts/{id}/export/auth` call fails
- **THEN** a toast notification shows the error message
- **AND** no modal opens

### Requirement: Reset-window routing setting UI
The dashboard routing settings UI SHALL expose a control for the earlier-reset
preference window whenever earlier-reset routing preference is configurable. The
control SHALL allow only `primary` and `secondary` values and SHALL submit the
selected value using the settings API field `preferEarlierResetWindow`.

#### Scenario: Operator selects primary reset window
- **GIVEN** the routing settings UI is open
- **WHEN** the operator selects `primary` as the earlier-reset window
- **THEN** the settings update payload includes `preferEarlierResetWindow: "primary"`

#### Scenario: Imported settings preserve reset-window preference
- **GIVEN** an imported settings payload includes `preferEarlierResetWindow`
- **WHEN** the settings import is applied
- **THEN** the imported value is sent to the backend instead of being dropped

### Requirement: Accounts page exposes security-work authorization

The Accounts page SHALL let operators view and update whether an account is authorized for upstream cybersecurity work without losing existing account actions such as pause, resume, re-authenticate, export, and delete.

#### Scenario: Account security-work authorization is toggled

- **WHEN** an operator toggles Trusted Access for Cyber for an account
- **THEN** the app sends the account update request with the requested `securityWorkAuthorized` value
- **AND** the account list and dashboard overview data are invalidated after the update succeeds

#### Scenario: Security-work authorization appears in account summaries

- **WHEN** an account summary has `securityWorkAuthorized=true`
- **THEN** the Accounts page shows that account as eligible for Trusted Access for Cyber routing

### Requirement: Settings page exposes split sticky reallocation thresholds
The Settings page SHALL include sections for: routing settings (sticky threads, reset priority, prompt-cache affinity TTL), password management (setup/change/remove), TOTP management (setup/disable), API key auth toggle, API key management (table, create, edit, delete, regenerate), and sticky-session administration.

#### Scenario: Save split sticky reallocation thresholds
- **WHEN** a user updates the primary or secondary sticky reallocation threshold from the routing settings section
- **THEN** the app calls `PUT /api/settings` with the updated split threshold fields
- **AND** the saved settings response reflects both split sticky reallocation thresholds

### Requirement: Dashboard account cards show live credit state

Account summary responses SHALL expose the latest upstream credit metadata for
each account as nullable `creditsHas`, `creditsUnlimited`, and `creditsBalance`
fields. The dashboard account schema SHALL accept those fields.

The dashboard account card SHALL render a compact Credits row. If
`creditsUnlimited` is true, the value SHALL be `Unlimited`. Otherwise, when a
numeric credit balance is available it SHALL render that balance. If no credit
balance is available, the card MAY fall back to the account's remaining weekly
or primary credit value, and SHALL render `-` when no credit value is known.

#### Scenario: Unlimited credits render explicitly

- **WHEN** an account summary has `creditsUnlimited = true`
- **THEN** the dashboard account card shows `Credits: Unlimited`

#### Scenario: Positive credit balance renders on the card

- **WHEN** an account summary includes `creditsBalance = 1.5`
- **THEN** the dashboard account card shows that numeric credit balance

#### Scenario: Missing credit data renders a placeholder

- **WHEN** an account summary has no credit balance and no remaining credit fallback
- **THEN** the dashboard account card shows `Credits: -`

### Requirement: Dashboard settings must expose upstream proxy routing controls
The settings dashboard MUST allow operators to inspect upstream proxy routing state, enable or disable routing, choose the default proxy pool, create proxy endpoints, create proxy pools, and add endpoints to pools.

#### Scenario: Operator creates a pool from existing endpoints
- **GIVEN** the upstream proxy admin API returns at least one endpoint
- **WHEN** an operator creates a pool and selects endpoint members
- **THEN** the dashboard MUST call the pool creation API with the selected endpoint ids
- **AND** refresh the displayed upstream proxy admin state.

### Requirement: Dashboard accounts must expose account proxy bindings
The accounts dashboard MUST allow operators to bind an account to a proxy pool and disable an existing account binding.

#### Scenario: Operator binds an account to a pool
- **GIVEN** upstream proxy routing has at least one proxy pool
- **WHEN** an operator selects a pool for an account and saves the binding
- **THEN** the dashboard MUST call the account binding API for that account
- **AND** display the selected pool as the account binding.

### Requirement: Accounts page distinguishes re-authentication-required state

Account status displays and filters SHALL distinguish `reauth_required`
accounts from `deactivated` accounts:
`reauth_required` means the local credential/session must be refreshed by
operator re-authentication, while `deactivated` means the upstream account is
disabled, suspended, deleted, or explicitly deactivated.

#### Scenario: Re-authentication-required account is labeled separately

- **WHEN** an account summary has `status = "reauth_required"`
- **THEN** the account list and account detail status badge show
  `Re-auth required`
- **AND** the account can be found with the status filter for
  `reauth_required`
- **AND** the account detail exposes the re-authenticate action
- **AND** the account detail does not expose pause or resume actions that could
  bypass re-authentication
- **AND** the account list and account detail do not expose routing-policy
  controls that imply the account is selectable while operator recovery is
  required

### Requirement: Dashboard tolerates browser translation DOM mutation

The dashboard HTML shell SHALL allow browser/extension translation while protecting React reconciliation from external DOM node moves.

#### Scenario: Dashboard permits browser translation

- **WHEN** the browser loads the dashboard HTML shell
- **THEN** the document, body, and React root do not opt out of browser translation

#### Scenario: Dashboard tolerates externally moved React nodes

- **WHEN** an extension moves a React-owned DOM node before React removes or inserts around it
- **THEN** the dashboard startup guard logs the external mutation
- **AND** the guarded DOM operation returns without throwing a reconciliation-stopping exception

### Requirement: Accounts list supports explicit sort modes

The Accounts page account list SHALL expose sort modes for reset time
soonest-first, reset time latest-first, account name ascending, and account name
descending. The default sort mode SHALL remain reset time soonest-first. The
same selected sort mode SHALL apply to both the rendered account list and the
page-level selected-account fallback.

#### Scenario: Reset soonest remains the default

- **WHEN** the account list renders without an explicit sort mode
- **THEN** accounts with the earliest upcoming visible quota reset sort first

#### Scenario: Reset latest sorts finite resets descending

- **WHEN** a user selects reset time latest-first
- **THEN** accounts with later upcoming visible quota resets sort before
  accounts with earlier upcoming visible quota resets
- **AND** accounts without an upcoming visible reset timestamp sort after
  accounts with finite upcoming reset timestamps

#### Scenario: Name sort modes order by account label

- **WHEN** a user selects account name ascending or descending
- **THEN** the account list orders accounts by display name, email, or account
  identifier in the selected direction

### Requirement: API key overview SHALL show lifetime usage aggregates

The dashboard API key overview SHALL present usage totals using the API key list
`usageSummary` values as lifetime aggregates (all non-warmup request-log history),
unless the backend contract is changed to provide a bounded window explicitly.

#### Scenario: Overview usage labels reflect lifetime scope

- **WHEN** the API key overview renders `usageSummary` values for request count,
  token count, and cost
- **THEN** the section labels SHALL read as lifetime usage (for example:
  "Lifetime Requests", "Lifetime Cost", "Lifetime Cost by API Key", "Lifetime Tokens
  by API Key"), and SHALL NOT be labeled as 7-day totals.

### Requirement: Dashboard request-log details expose user-agent metadata
The dashboard request-log API response MUST expose the persisted request-log `useragent` and `useragentGroup` values when present. The Request Details dialog MUST render the full `useragent` value in a `User Agent` field below the `Transport`, `Time`, and `Error Code` row, and MUST render `—` when no full user-agent value is stored.

#### Scenario: Request details show the full stored user-agent
- **WHEN** a request log entry is stored with `useragent: "opencode/1.15.13 ai-sdk/provider-utils/4.0.23 runtime/bun/1.3.14"` and `useragentGroup: "opencode"`
- **THEN** the `GET /api/request-logs` response includes both values for that row
- **AND** the Request Details dialog shows `User Agent` with the full stored string

#### Scenario: Request details show a placeholder for legacy rows
- **WHEN** a request log entry has `useragent: null`
- **THEN** the `GET /api/request-logs` response includes `useragent: null` and `useragentGroup: null` or omits them as nullable fields
- **AND** the Request Details dialog renders `User Agent` as `—`

### Requirement: `/api/reports` returns nullable account buckets safely

`GET /api/reports` SHALL return an `accountId` field for each `byAccount` item that is either a string account identifier or `null`.
The system MUST preserve rows with `account_id IS NULL` and return them as a separate account bucket with `accountId: null` so historical usage is still represented.

#### Scenario: Null accountId is serialized for historical rows
- **WHEN** request logs in the selected period include rows with `account_id = NULL`
- **AND** those rows have non-null `cost_usd`
- **THEN** the `byAccount` response includes an item with `accountId: null`
- **AND** response serialization succeeds without schema validation failure

### Requirement: Reports data path uses backend-side date grouping

`GET /api/reports` SHALL use backend-side date grouping logic for both PostgreSQL and SQLite, producing `YYYY-MM-DD` daily buckets for stable trend display and CSV export.

#### Scenario: SQLite report request returns date buckets
- **WHEN** the repository is SQLite
- **AND** `/api/reports` is called with a valid date range
- **THEN** the response contains `daily` entries with `date` values in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- **AND** the endpoint responds with HTTP 200

### Requirement: Reports API is accessible through the dashboard route map

The dashboard surface SHALL expose a reports page at route `/reports` and route to data loaded from `GET /api/reports` with `startDate`, `endDate`, `accountId`, and `model` filters.

#### Scenario: Dashboard reports page uses `/api/reports`
- **WHEN** an authenticated operator opens `/reports`
- **THEN** the page loads the aggregated reports payload from `GET /api/reports`
- **AND** allows filtering by date range, model, and account
- **AND** uses the returned payload to render summary cards, daily charts, and model distribution

### Requirement: Dashboard accounts section shows account availability summary

The dashboard `Accounts` section SHALL render a compact summary derived from the existing dashboard overview accounts collection. The summary SHALL show the total registered account count, the active account count, and the unavailable account count.

An account SHALL count as active only when its dashboard status normalizes to `active`. Accounts whose normalized status is `paused`, `limited`, `exceeded`, `reauth`, or `deactivated` SHALL count as unavailable.

The summary SHALL render in the `Accounts` section header row and SHALL use the project's existing foreground, muted, positive, and negative theme color conventions for light and dark mode.

#### Scenario: Mixed account states show registered, active, and unavailable counts

- **WHEN** `GET /api/dashboard/overview` returns three accounts with statuses `active`, `paused`, and `rate_limited`
- **THEN** the dashboard `Accounts` section header shows `3 registered`
- **AND** shows `1 active`
- **AND** shows `2 unavailable`

#### Scenario: Only normalized active accounts count as active

- **WHEN** `GET /api/dashboard/overview` returns accounts with statuses `active`, `quota_exceeded`, `reauth_required`, and `deactivated`
- **THEN** only the `active` account contributes to the active count
- **AND** the other three accounts contribute to the unavailable count

#### Scenario: Theme-aware colors match dashboard conventions

- **WHEN** the dashboard renders in light mode or dark mode
- **THEN** the registered count uses foreground styling
- **AND** the labels use muted-foreground styling
- **AND** the active count uses the dashboard positive green styling
- **AND** the unavailable count uses the dashboard negative red styling

### Requirement: Dashboard overview summary cards show previous-window usage deltas

The dashboard overview API SHALL expose previous-window comparison data for the existing `Requests`, `Tokens`, and `Est. API Cost` summary cards returned by `GET /api/dashboard/overview`. The comparison SHALL be tied to the selected overview timeframe so that `1d` compares the current 1-day window with the immediately preceding 1-day window, `7d` compares the current 7-day window with the immediately preceding 7-day window, and `30d` compares the current 30-day window with the immediately preceding 30-day window.

The overview response SHALL include a comparison block that exposes whether previous-window comparison is allowed and the previous-window totals for requests, tokens, and estimated API cost. The dashboard SHALL use that block to render a compact percentage-change indicator on the existing `Requests`, `Tokens`, and `Est. API Cost` cards only. The dashboard MUST NOT add this indicator to `Error rate` or `Account burn projection`.

If the immediately preceding window is not fully covered by eligible request-log history for the selected timeframe, the overview response SHALL mark the comparison as unavailable and the dashboard SHALL hide the percentage-change indicator for those cards.

If previous-window comparison is available and the previous total for a card is greater than zero, the dashboard SHALL calculate the displayed change from the current total relative to the previous total, SHALL show increases with an upward indicator using the project's positive `emerald` styling, and SHALL show decreases with a downward indicator using the project's negative `red` styling.

#### Scenario: Daily overview renders increase from previous window

- **WHEN** `GET /api/dashboard/overview?timeframe=1d` returns current totals for requests, tokens, and estimated API cost plus comparison data with `canCompare: true`
- **AND** the previous-window totals are lower than the current-window totals
- **THEN** the dashboard renders percentage-change indicators on the `Requests`, `Tokens`, and `Est. API Cost` cards
- **AND** each increase uses an upward indicator with positive `emerald` styling

#### Scenario: Weekly overview renders decrease from previous window

- **WHEN** `GET /api/dashboard/overview?timeframe=7d` returns comparison data with `canCompare: true`
- **AND** at least one of the previous-window totals for requests, tokens, or estimated API cost is higher than the current-window total for that same card
- **THEN** the dashboard renders a downward percentage-change indicator for that card
- **AND** that decrease uses negative `red` styling

#### Scenario: Partial previous window suppresses comparison

- **WHEN** `GET /api/dashboard/overview?timeframe=7d` or `GET /api/dashboard/overview?timeframe=30d` cannot prove the immediately preceding same-length window is fully covered by eligible request-log history
- **THEN** the overview response marks the comparison as unavailable
- **AND** the dashboard does not render percentage-change indicators on the `Requests`, `Tokens`, or `Est. API Cost` cards

#### Scenario: Non-comparison cards remain unchanged

- **WHEN** the dashboard renders overview cards from `GET /api/dashboard/overview` with or without comparison data
- **THEN** `Error rate` and `Account burn projection` do not render previous-window percentage-change indicators

### Requirement: Dashboard estimated cost card meta avoids duplicate estimate and cache copy

The dashboard overview `Est. API Cost` summary card SHALL render its meta text as only the averaged cost for the selected overview timeframe. The meta text MUST NOT append duplicate estimate wording or cached-token counts.

#### Scenario: Weekly estimated cost card shows only average-per-day text

- **WHEN** `GET /api/dashboard/overview?timeframe=7d` returns an `Est. API Cost` total and the summary metrics also include cached input tokens
- **THEN** the dashboard renders the cost-card meta text as `Avg/day <currency value>`
- **AND** the same meta text does not include `API estimate`
- **AND** the same meta text does not include `cached`

#### Scenario: Daily estimated cost card shows only average-per-hour text

- **WHEN** `GET /api/dashboard/overview?timeframe=1d` returns an `Est. API Cost` total
- **THEN** the dashboard renders the cost-card meta text as `Avg/hr <currency value>`
- **AND** the same meta text does not include any extra suffix text

### Requirement: Upstream proxy admin creation flows use modal dialogs

The Settings upstream proxy section SHALL present endpoint creation, pool creation, and
pool-member addition as modal dialogs opened from explicit trigger buttons. The creation form
fields (endpoint name/scheme/host/port/credentials, pool name/member selection, pool-member
pool/endpoint selectors) SHALL NOT be rendered in the always-visible Settings layout; they
SHALL only mount when their dialog is open. Submitting a creation dialog SHALL call the existing
upstream proxy admin mutation, refresh the displayed admin state, and close the dialog on success;
a failed submission SHALL keep the dialog open so the operator can retry.

#### Scenario: Creation forms are hidden until a dialog opens

- **WHEN** an operator views the Settings page upstream proxy section
- **THEN** no endpoint, pool, or pool-member creation input fields are present in the document
- **AND** the section shows trigger buttons for adding an endpoint, creating a pool, and adding a pool member

#### Scenario: Operator creates a pool from a dialog

- **GIVEN** the upstream proxy admin API returns at least one endpoint
- **WHEN** an operator opens the create-pool dialog, names the pool, selects endpoint members, and submits
- **THEN** the dashboard calls the pool creation API with the selected endpoint ids
- **AND** refreshes the displayed upstream proxy admin state
- **AND** closes the dialog

#### Scenario: Failed creation keeps the dialog open

- **WHEN** a creation dialog submission rejects with an error
- **THEN** the dialog remains open
- **AND** the entered values are preserved so the operator can retry

### Requirement: Upstream proxy admin section summarizes configured endpoints and pools

The always-visible Settings upstream proxy section SHALL render a summary/management view that
shows the routing-enabled toggle, the default-pool selector, and readable lists of the configured
endpoints and pools (including each pool's active state and endpoint count). When no endpoints or
no pools are configured, the section SHALL show an explicit empty state for that list rather than
a blank region.

#### Scenario: Configured endpoints and pools are listed

- **WHEN** the upstream proxy admin state includes endpoints and pools
- **THEN** the section lists each endpoint with its scheme, host, and port
- **AND** lists each pool with its active state and endpoint count

#### Scenario: Empty proxy configuration shows an empty state

- **WHEN** the upstream proxy admin state has no endpoints and no pools
- **THEN** the section shows an explicit empty-state message for endpoints and for pools

### Requirement: Account routing and proxy-binding controls size predictably

The account detail routing-policy selector and the account proxy-pool selector SHALL size
themselves responsively within their container instead of using an arbitrary fixed pixel width,
and SHALL truncate long option labels gracefully rather than overflowing their container or
collapsing below a usable minimum width.

#### Scenario: Routing-policy select fills its control row

- **WHEN** the account detail panel renders the routing-policy selector
- **THEN** the selector trigger constrains its width to its container with a usable minimum
- **AND** does not hardcode a fixed `w-44` width

#### Scenario: Long proxy-pool name is truncated

- **WHEN** the account proxy-pool selector renders a pool whose name is longer than the trigger width
- **THEN** the selected label is truncated with an ellipsis within the trigger
- **AND** the selector does not overflow its container

### Requirement: Account list presents a single add-account entry point with a chooser dialog

The account list SHALL present account creation through a single dashed-border placeholder control
rendered at the bottom of the list, instead of separate always-visible "Import" and "Add Account"
buttons. Activating the placeholder SHALL open a modal chooser dialog offering two options: adding
an account via OAuth and importing an exported `auth.json` file. Selecting an option SHALL close the
chooser and open the corresponding existing flow (the OAuth dialog or the import dialog) via the
existing handlers, without changing those flows' behavior.

#### Scenario: Add-account placeholder opens the chooser

- **WHEN** an operator views the account list
- **THEN** a single "Add account" placeholder control is shown at the bottom of the list
- **AND** no separate always-visible "Import" or "Add Account" buttons are present
- **WHEN** the operator activates the placeholder
- **THEN** a chooser dialog opens offering an "Add account" (OAuth) option and an "Import" option

#### Scenario: Choosing an option opens its existing flow

- **GIVEN** the add-account chooser dialog is open
- **WHEN** the operator selects the "Add account" option
- **THEN** the chooser closes and the existing OAuth sign-in dialog opens
- **WHEN** the operator instead selects the "Import" option
- **THEN** the chooser closes and the existing `auth.json` import dialog opens

### Requirement: Account list status filter shares the help row

The account list search input SHALL span the full width of the list controls, and the account
status filter SHALL be positioned on the same row as the "Need help?" toggle rather than beside the
search input.

#### Scenario: Status filter renders on the help row

- **WHEN** an operator views the account list
- **THEN** the search input occupies the full width of the controls row
- **AND** the account status filter control is rendered on the same row as the "Need help?" toggle

### Requirement: Account alias is edited inline from the detail header

The account detail header SHALL display the account's local label (the alias when set, otherwise the
display name or email) next to an edit (pencil) control, and SHALL NOT render a separate always-visible
alias form. Activating the edit control SHALL replace the label with an inline text input pre-filled
with the current alias plus confirm and cancel controls. Confirming SHALL persist the alias via the
existing alias handler (an empty value clears the alias) and return to the display state; cancelling
SHALL discard the edit without a network call. When an alias is set, the header SHALL still surface the
account email as a subtitle so the underlying account remains identifiable.

#### Scenario: Pencil reveals the inline alias editor

- **WHEN** an operator views the account detail header
- **THEN** the account local label is shown next to an "Edit alias" control
- **AND** no separate "Account alias" form card is rendered
- **WHEN** the operator activates the "Edit alias" control
- **THEN** the label is replaced by a text input pre-filled with the current alias, with save and cancel controls

#### Scenario: Saving and clearing the alias inline

- **GIVEN** the inline alias editor is open
- **WHEN** the operator enters a label and confirms
- **THEN** the alias is persisted via the existing alias handler and the header returns to the display state
- **WHEN** the operator clears the input and confirms
- **THEN** the alias is cleared via the existing alias handler

#### Scenario: Cancelling discards the edit

- **GIVEN** the inline alias editor is open with unsaved changes
- **WHEN** the operator cancels
- **THEN** the editor closes without calling the alias handler
- **AND** the displayed label is unchanged

### Requirement: Accounts page distinguishes workspace credential slots

The Accounts page SHALL preserve and visibly distinguish separate credential
slots that share a login identity but represent different workspaces.

#### Scenario: Same-email workspace slots are distinguishable

- **WHEN** the account list contains multiple accounts with the same email
- **AND** at least one account has workspace metadata
- **THEN** the list and detail views show workspace identity or compact account id context sufficient to distinguish the credential slots

#### Scenario: Same-login workspace slots are preserved

- **WHEN** multiple imported or OAuth-completed credentials share the same ChatGPT account identity
- **AND** they carry distinct workspace ids or workspace labels
- **THEN** each workspace credential is preserved as a separate local account slot

#### Scenario: Import copy reflects credential slots

- **WHEN** a user views import settings
- **THEN** the copy describes preserving separate workspace or unknown credential slots instead of email-level duplicates

### Requirement: Reports API SHALL reject oversized daily ranges

`GET /api/reports` SHALL reject requests whose inclusive `start_date` to
`end_date` span exceeds 730 calendar days after applying endpoint defaults for
any omitted bound.

#### Scenario: Oversized report range is rejected

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator requests `/api/reports` with a date span
  longer than 730 days
- **THEN** the API returns a 400-class response
- **AND** the backend does not expand the request into per-day report buckets

#### Scenario: Single-bound report range is validated after defaults

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator requests `/api/reports` with only
  `start_date` set to a date more than 730 days before the effective end date
- **THEN** the API returns a 400-class response
- **AND** the backend does not expand the request into per-day report buckets

### Requirement: Reports page sends browser-local timezone context

The `/reports` page SHALL detect the browser's current IANA timezone, cache the latest detected valid value locally for convenience, and include a valid timezone in `GET /api/reports` requests whenever one is available. The page SHALL prefer the browser's current valid timezone over any cached value, SHALL reuse the cached valid timezone when live detection is unavailable or invalid, and SHALL omit the `timezone` query parameter only when neither the live nor cached value is valid.

#### Scenario: Reports page includes browser timezone on requests

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator opens `/reports` or changes a report filter
- **THEN** the request to `GET /api/reports` includes the browser's current IANA timezone in the `timezone` query parameter when detection succeeds

#### Scenario: Reports page reuses cached timezone when live detection fails

- **WHEN** the browser cannot provide a valid IANA timezone name
- **AND** the page has a cached valid timezone from an earlier successful detection
- **THEN** the reports page still requests `GET /api/reports`
- **AND** the request uses the cached valid timezone in the `timezone` query parameter

#### Scenario: Reports page omits timezone only when no valid timezone is available

- **WHEN** the browser cannot provide a valid IANA timezone name
- **AND** the page does not have a cached valid timezone
- **THEN** the reports page still requests `GET /api/reports`
- **AND** the request omits the `timezone` query parameter

### Requirement: Reports endpoint applies timezone-aware ranges and daily bucketing

`GET /api/reports` SHALL interpret `start_date` and `end_date` as calendar dates in the supplied IANA timezone, convert those local-midnight boundaries to UTC for filtering, and group `daily` rows by calendar day in that same timezone. When the timezone is missing or invalid, the endpoint MUST fall back to UTC.

#### Scenario: Reports endpoint uses local-day buckets before UTC midnight

- **WHEN** `/api/reports` receives `start_date`, `end_date`, and `timezone=America/Los_Angeles`
- **AND** a request log row falls on `2026-06-02T01:30:00Z`
- **THEN** the row is included in the `2026-06-01` daily bucket for that response

#### Scenario: Reports endpoint falls back to UTC for invalid timezone

- **WHEN** `/api/reports` receives an invalid `timezone` value
- **THEN** the endpoint still returns a successful response
- **AND** it interprets the report range and daily buckets in UTC

### Requirement: Reports summary cards show previous-window deltas conservatively

`GET /api/reports` SHALL expose a `comparison` block for the `Total Cost`, `Tokens`, and `Requests` summary cards that includes `canCompare` plus the previous-window totals for cost, tokens, and requests. The current window and previous window SHALL use equal calendar-window lengths derived from the selected report date range. The endpoint SHALL set `canCompare` to `true` only when eligible report history fully covers the immediately preceding window. When `canCompare` is `false`, the `/reports` summary cards SHALL hide the previous-window percentage indicators. Even when `canCompare` is `true`, an individual summary card SHALL hide its own percentage indicator when that card's previous-window total is zero.

#### Scenario: Reports summary cards show previous-window increase

- **WHEN** `GET /api/reports` returns current summary totals plus `comparison.canCompare: true`
- **AND** a previous-window total for `Total Cost`, `Tokens`, or `Requests` is lower than the current total for that same card
- **THEN** the matching summary card renders a visible percentage-change increase indicator

#### Scenario: Incomplete previous window suppresses comparison

- **WHEN** the earliest eligible report activity is later than the start of the immediately preceding report window
- **THEN** `GET /api/reports` returns `comparison.canCompare: false`
- **AND** the `/reports` summary cards do not render previous-window percentage indicators

#### Scenario: Zero previous total suppresses the matching card indicator

- **WHEN** `GET /api/reports` returns `comparison.canCompare: true`
- **AND** the previous-window total for one of `Total Cost`, `Tokens`, or `Requests` is `0`
- **THEN** that summary card does not render a previous-window percentage indicator
- **AND** the other summary cards may still render percentage indicators when their own previous-window totals are greater than `0`

### Requirement: Reports daily breakdown renders a continuous calendar window

The `/reports` daily breakdown table SHALL render one row per calendar day in the selected date range. Each row SHALL display its date as an ISO `yyyy-mm-dd` calendar date string. If the reports API omits one or more days inside that range, the table SHALL synthesize zero-valued rows for those days using the same row styling as API-backed rows. The table SHALL keep the header visible while only the data rows scroll, with a default visible body height of seven row heights.

#### Scenario: Daily breakdown fills missing days with zero-valued rows

- **WHEN** the selected reports window spans `2026-06-05` through `2026-06-12`
- **AND** the reports API returns daily rows for every day except `2026-06-06`
- **THEN** the daily breakdown renders a row for `2026-06-06`
- **AND** that row shows zero requests, zero input tokens, zero output tokens, zero cost, and zero accounts
- **AND** that row uses the same row styling as neighboring rows

#### Scenario: Daily breakdown header stays visible while rows scroll

- **WHEN** the daily breakdown contains more than seven rows
- **THEN** the table header remains visible
- **AND** only the table body scrolls vertically through the remaining rows

#### Scenario: Daily breakdown preserves ISO bucket dates

- **WHEN** the reports API returns a daily bucket row with `date` set to `2026-06-01`
- **THEN** the daily breakdown table renders that row label as `2026-06-01`

### Requirement: Reports model distribution donut remains cost-based without center text

The `/reports` model distribution donut SHALL size each slice from cost data and SHALL continue to show cost values in the donut legend and tooltip. The donut SHALL NOT render a center value while idle or on hover.

#### Scenario: Donut shows cost without center label

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator opens `/reports` with model distribution data
- **THEN** the donut uses cost-based slices and cost-valued legend entries
- **AND** the donut does not render center text

### Requirement: Reports daily charts use symmetric horizontal padding

The `/reports` `Cost by Day` and `Tokens by Day` charts SHALL use equal left and right horizontal plot padding within their chart cards.

#### Scenario: Daily charts render with balanced left and right inset

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator opens `/reports`
- **THEN** the `Cost by Day` and `Tokens by Day` charts render with equal left and right horizontal padding around the plotted area

### Requirement: Dashboard accounts section supports card and list views

The Dashboard Accounts section SHALL allow operators to choose between the existing card layout and a compact list layout. The default mode SHALL remain cards. The selected account view mode SHALL persist locally and apply on later dashboard visits.

The list layout SHALL use the same dashboard overview account collection as the card layout and SHALL expose account identity, status, plan, quota remaining, credits, limit warm-up state, and the same account actions available from the card layout. The list quota cells SHALL include compact visual meters for each rendered quota row while preserving numeric percent and reset timing text. The Account, Status, Plan, Quota, Credits, and Warm-up list headers SHALL be clickable sort controls.

#### Scenario: Dashboard defaults to card view

- **WHEN** the account view-mode preference is unset
- **THEN** the Dashboard Accounts section renders account cards
- **AND** the card/list control indicates card mode is selected

#### Scenario: Operator switches to list view

- **WHEN** an operator selects list mode in the Dashboard Accounts section
- **THEN** the account cards are replaced by a compact list of the same accounts
- **AND** the list exposes each account's status, quota, credits, warm-up state, and available actions
- **AND** each quota row includes a compact visual remaining-capacity meter

#### Scenario: Operator sorts account list columns

- **WHEN** an operator clicks a sortable list header
- **THEN** the account list sorts by that column in ascending order
- **AND** clicking the same header again toggles the sort direction
- **AND** the active sort header exposes its sort direction to assistive technology

#### Scenario: Account view mode persists locally

- **WHEN** an operator selects list mode
- **AND** later returns to the dashboard in the same browser profile
- **THEN** the Dashboard Accounts section renders in list mode without requiring another selection

### Requirement: CodexNeo dashboard route

The dashboard SHALL expose a CodexNeo route in the primary navigation near APIs and Settings.

#### Scenario: Admin opens CodexNeo tab

- **WHEN** an admin opens the CodexNeo tab
- **THEN** the page SHALL show controls for Codex API base URL, Auth->API Test, Auth->API Set, Auth->API Revert, CodexGO auto-refresh, refresh interval minutes, buyer token, provider URL, Use auth, and Refresh auth

#### Scenario: Guest opens CodexNeo tab

- **WHEN** a read-only guest opens the CodexNeo tab
- **THEN** settings MAY be visible except plaintext secrets
- **AND** mutating controls SHALL be disabled

#### Scenario: Buyer token is saved

- **WHEN** a buyer token is already saved
- **THEN** the UI SHALL indicate that a token exists without rendering the token value

#### Scenario: Admin views activity log

- **WHEN** an admin opens the CodexNeo tab
- **THEN** the page SHALL show OpenAI log and Management log toggles
- **AND** the page SHALL show an Activity log panel with a Clear button

#### Scenario: Admin views Codex Home accounts

- **WHEN** an admin opens the CodexNeo tab
- **THEN** the page SHALL show a Codex Home account table populated from the safe account discovery API
- **AND** the table SHALL NOT render auth secrets
