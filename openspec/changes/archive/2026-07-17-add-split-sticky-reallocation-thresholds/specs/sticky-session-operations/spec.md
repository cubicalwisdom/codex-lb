## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Sticky sessions are explicitly typed

The system SHALL persist each sticky-session mapping with an explicit kind so durable Codex backend affinity, durable dashboard sticky-thread routing, and bounded prompt-cache affinity can be managed independently.

#### Scenario: Backend Codex session affinity is stored as durable

- **WHEN** a backend Codex request creates or refreshes stickiness from `session_id`
- **THEN** the stored mapping kind is `codex_session`

#### Scenario: Backend Codex session rebinds under budget pressure

- **WHEN** a backend Codex request resolves an existing `codex_session` mapping
- **AND** the pinned account is strictly above either the configured primary sticky reallocation threshold or the configured secondary sticky reallocation threshold
- **AND** another eligible account remains at or below both configured sticky reallocation thresholds
- **THEN** selection rebinds the durable `codex_session` mapping to the healthier account before sending the request upstream

#### Scenario: Dashboard sticky thread routing is stored as durable

- **WHEN** sticky-thread routing creates or refreshes stickiness from a prompt-derived key
- **THEN** the stored mapping kind is `sticky_thread`

#### Scenario: OpenAI prompt-cache affinity is stored as bounded

- **WHEN** an OpenAI-style request creates or refreshes prompt-cache affinity
- **THEN** the stored mapping kind is `prompt_cache`

#### Scenario: Identical keys remain isolated across sticky-session kinds

- **WHEN** the same sticky-session key value is used for more than one kind
- **THEN** each `(key, kind)` mapping is stored and managed independently without overwriting the others

#### Scenario: Dashboard sticky thread rebinds under budget pressure

- **WHEN** a request resolves an existing `sticky_thread` mapping
- **AND** the pinned account is otherwise eligible to serve traffic
- **AND** the pinned account is strictly above either the configured primary sticky reallocation threshold or the configured secondary sticky reallocation threshold
- **AND** another eligible account remains at or below both configured sticky reallocation thresholds
- **THEN** selection rebinds the durable `sticky_thread` mapping to the healthier account before sending the request upstream

#### Scenario: Dashboard sticky thread is preserved when every candidate is above the threshold

- **WHEN** a request resolves an existing `sticky_thread` mapping
- **AND** the pinned account is otherwise eligible to serve traffic
- **AND** the pinned account is strictly above either configured sticky reallocation threshold
- **AND** every other eligible account is also strictly above at least one configured sticky reallocation threshold
- **THEN** selection retains the existing pinned account to avoid sticky-pin thrashing

#### Scenario: Sticky reallocation uses split primary and secondary pressure thresholds

- **WHEN** a request resolves an existing sticky-session mapping
- **AND** the pinned account is otherwise eligible to serve traffic
- **AND** the pinned account is strictly above either the configured primary sticky reallocation threshold or the configured secondary sticky reallocation threshold
- **AND** another eligible account remains at or below both configured sticky reallocation thresholds
- **THEN** selection rebinds the sticky-session mapping to the healthier account before sending the request upstream

#### Scenario: Sticky reallocation preserves a pinned account when every candidate is split-threshold pressured

- **WHEN** a request resolves an existing sticky-session mapping
- **AND** the pinned account is otherwise eligible to serve traffic
- **AND** the pinned account is strictly above either configured sticky reallocation threshold
- **AND** every other eligible account is also strictly above at least one configured sticky reallocation threshold
- **THEN** selection retains the existing pinned account to avoid sticky-pin thrashing

#### Scenario: Fresh selection does not apply sticky secondary pressure threshold

- **WHEN** a request has no sticky-session mapping
- **AND** one eligible account is above the configured secondary sticky reallocation threshold but below the normal primary budget threshold
- **THEN** the account remains eligible for ordinary non-sticky routing according to the selected routing strategy
