## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Accounts page distinguishes workspace credential slots

The Accounts page SHALL preserve and visibly distinguish separate credential
slots that share a login identity but represent different workspaces.

#### Scenario: Same-email workspace slots are distinguishable

- **WHEN** the account list contains multiple accounts with the same email
- **AND** at least one account has workspace metadata
- **THEN** the list and detail views show workspace identity or compact account id context sufficient to distinguish the credential slots

#### Scenario: Same-login workspace slots are preserved

- **WHEN** multiple imported or OAuth-completed credentials share the same ChatGPT account identity
- **AND** they carry distinct workspace ids or workspace labels
- **THEN** each workspace credential is preserved as a separate local account slot

#### Scenario: Import copy reflects credential slots

- **WHEN** a user views import settings
- **THEN** the copy describes preserving separate workspace or unknown credential slots instead of email-level duplicates
